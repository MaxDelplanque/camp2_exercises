//Let's mix what we learned today. We want to make a function that will give us the temperature from a vague string.
//Something like that: temperatureAt("Decathlon Campus"); // Displays 17 ËšC.
//The goal is to use only one chain of Promise to first get the coordinates from
//Google Places Web Service and then pass the coordinates to the previous 
//function weatherByLatitudeAndLongitude and then display the temperature.
